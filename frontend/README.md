## Design

### Colour Scheme

- I wanted the colour scheme to be very plain with a stylish look, so I will keep it simple using black and whites and greys.  

### Typography 

I will be using a font from Google Fonts named Arimo for the majority of the site.

### Imagery

All the static images on the site are centred around vegan clothes and products. I will try to find images with neutral tones to fit in with the basic colour scheme. 

### Wireframes

Wireframes for each page are linked here:
