        Not so long ago we embarked on a journey with you to offer
        animal-friendly lifestyle products to the world. Our initial focus was
        on the leather-intensive footwear industry. Within a few years, we've
        successfully positioned ourselves as a leading and fashion-forward brand
        within the global vegan community. Our vegan product lines are currently
        available not only from our London headquarters but also throughout the
        U.K, Europe, The Americas, Asia, and Australasia. Over 30,000
        individuals worldwide now walk the Earth in our cruelty-free shoes
        daily. Excitingly, we are now expanding our PBB offerings to include
        personal care products.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can embrace a fantastic lifestyle without causing harm to animals or
        the planet.

        prioritizes the welfare of both animals and humans.

      <p>
        You don't have to identify as a vegan to appreciate our PETA-approved
        vegan items. Whether you're contemplating embracing the vegan movement,
        just starting out, or have been dedicated to a plant-based lifestyle for
        an extended period, our products are tailored for universal wear. By
        donning and endorsing our brand, you contribute to the dissemination of
        the crucial vegan message within your local communities.
